Installation
==============

The supported installation method is using the official
`Docker images <https://gitlab.com/jaywink/socialhome/container_registry>`_. If you simply
cannot use Docker, a horribly out of date manual install guide exists which can be followed.
You're on your own to make it work or provide a better documented guide!

These instructions are for a production installation. For development installation instructions, see the :ref:`development` pages.

**Docker guide**: :ref:`installation-docker`

Manual out of date guide (**with dragons**): :ref:`installation-ubuntu`
